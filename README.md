# Digiglobe-Solutions-Web-Developer-Role
I completed my web developer internship at Digiglobe Solution, where I was given the responsibility of working on a comprehensive project involving a portfolio website, a news app, and an e-commerce platform. To make the most out of this opportunity, I focused on building the portfolio website, as it allows me to showcase not only my skills and knowledge but also the real-world projects I’ve worked on during the internship. Creating this portfolio wasn’t just about finishing the task—it’s something I’ll carry forward, helping me in my career ahead. Nowadays, recruiters don’t just rely on resumes; they want to see tangible work through portfolios, and I made sure mine reflects my abilities and potential!
